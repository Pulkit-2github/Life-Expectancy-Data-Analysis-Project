## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to understand the key factors influencing life expectancy across different countries and predict life expectancy values using relevant socio-economic, demographic, and health indicators.

## Target variable: Life expectancy

## Key Questions:
üîπWhat features most strongly affect life expectancy?
üîπHow do economic indicators (like GDP, schooling, income composition) impact it?
üîπCan we build a predictive model to estimate life expectancy?

## Data Description
